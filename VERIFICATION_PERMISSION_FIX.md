# 🔧 Verification Permission Fix

## ❌ Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing Permissions Error (50013)** - Bot couldn't assign Verified role
2. **Duplicate Role Creation** - Setup created multiple roles without checking

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

### **1. Role Hierarchy Check**
The bot now:
- ✅ Checks if its role is above the Verified role
- ✅ Shows clear error message with current positions
- ✅ Provides step-by-step fix instructions
- ✅ Won't try to assign roles it can't manage

### **2. Duplicate Prevention**
The setup command now:
- ✅ Checks if verification channel already exists
- ✅ Checks if Verified role already exists
- ✅ Uses existing roles instead of creating duplicates
- ✅ Shows helpful message if already set up

### **3. Better Error Messages**
Users now see:
- ✅ Clear explanation of the problem
- ✅ Step-by-step fix instructions
- ✅ Current role positions
- ✅ What needs to be changed

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Server:

### **Step 1: Fix Role Hierarchy**

1. Go to **Server Settings** → **Roles**
2. Find your bot's role (e.g., "Beta Skyfall")
3. **Drag it ABOVE the "Verified" role**
4. Save changes

**Visual:**
```
✅ CORRECT:
├── Admin
├── Moderator
├── Beta Skyfall (Bot)    ← Bot role
├── Verified              ← Verified role
└── @everyone

❌ WRONG:
├── Admin
├── Moderator
├── Verified              ← Verified role
├── Beta Skyfall (Bot)    ← Bot role (too low!)
└── @everyone
```

### **Step 2: Update Bot on Pi**

SSH to your Pi:
```bash
cd ~/sapphire-modbot
git pull origin main
pm2 restart skyfall-bot
```

### **Step 3: Test Verification**

1. Go to verification channel
2. Click **Verify** button
3. Complete CAPTCHA
4. Should get verified! ✅
