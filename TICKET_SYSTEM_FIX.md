## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: "This interaction failed"
**Cause:** Button handler not registered
**Fix:** Already fixed - all handlers in `bot-with-api.js`

### Issue: "Cannot create channel"
**Cause:** Bot lacks permissions
**Fix:** Give bot "Manage Channels" permission or Administrator

### Issue: "Cannot send message"
**Cause:** Bot lacks permissions
**Fix:** Give bot "Send Messages" permission or Administrator

### Issue: "Staff not pinged"
**Cause:** No staff roles found
**Fix:** Create roles with names: staff, mod, moderator, admin, administrator, or support

### Issue: "Transcript not sent to user"
**Cause:** User has DMs disabled
**Fix:** Normal - bot logs this and continues

### Issue: "Buttons don't work in DMs"
**Cause:** Ticket buttons only work in servers
**Fix:** This is intentional - tickets are server-specific
