## STEP 1: CLEAN UP FILES

### What We're Doing:
Removing 100+ old/duplicate files to make the project clean and organized.

### Files to Keep:
```
✅ src/                    (Bot code)
✅ pages/                  (Dashboard pages)

❌ Old batch/shell scripts
```

### How to Clean Up:

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Run this in PowerShell:
cd C:\Users\Mikhail\CascadeProjects\sapphire-modbot
.\cleanup.ps1
```

**Option B: Manual**
- Delete files listed in `.cleanup-files.txt`
- Keep only the essential files listed above

### After Cleanup:
```
Your project will have:
- Clean, organized structure
- Only essential files
- Easy to navigate
- Professional setup
```

## STEP 2: TEST DISCORD COMMANDS

### What We're Doing:
Verifying that all 62 commands work in Discord (they should already work!)

### Open Discord:
1. Go to any server where the bot is installed
2. Type `/` to see all commands
3. You should see all Skyfall commands

### Test These Commands:

#### Basic Commands:
```
/ping
→ Should show: "🏓 Pong! Latency: XXms"

/help
→ Should show: List of all 62 commands

/serverinfo
→ Should show: Server details (members, boost level, etc.)

/userinfo
→ Should show: Your user info

/botinfo
→ Should show: Bot statistics
```

#### Fun Commands:
```
/8ball Is everything working?
→ Should give random answer

/coinflip
→ Should show: Heads or Tails

/dice sides:20
→ Should roll a 20-sided dice

/poll What's your favorite? | Red | Blue | Green
→ Should create a poll with reactions
```

#### Admin Commands:
```
/verify
→ Should create verification panel with button

/ticket setup
→ Should create ticket system

/announce This is a test!
→ Should send announcement embed
```

### Expected Results:
✅ All commands respond instantly
✅ Embeds look professional
✅ Buttons work
✅ Permissions are checked
✅ No errors in console

### If Commands Don't Work:
```bash
# On your Pi, run:
pm2 status
# Should show: discord-bot | online

# If not online:
pm2 restart discord-bot

# Check logs:
pm2 logs discord-bot --lines 20
```

## STEP 3: FIX WEBSITE LOGIN

### What We're Doing:
Making the website show your Discord profile when logged in, and keep you logged in until you sign out.

### The Problem:
- Website shows "Guest" even when logged in
- Discord profile not visible
- Session doesn't persist

### The Solution:
I've updated the dashboard to:
1. ✅ Show your Discord avatar in top right
2. ✅ Show your Discord username
3. ✅ Keep you logged in (24-hour session)
4. ✅ Add "Sign Out" button
5. ✅ Persist across page refreshes

### How to Test:
1. Go to: https://skyfall-omega.vercel.app
2. Click "Login with Discord"
3. Authorize the app
4. You should see:
   - ✅ Your Discord avatar (top right)
   - ✅ Your Discord username
   - ✅ "Sign Out" button
   - ✅ Your servers (if bot is in them)

### What You'll See:

**Before Login:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Skyfall Dashboard          │
│                             │
│  [Login with Discord] ←     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**After Login:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Skyfall Dashboard          │
│                    [👤 You] │
│                    Username │
│                  [Sign Out] │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## STEP 4: ADD BOT TO YOUR SERVER

### What We're Doing:
Adding the bot to a Discord server where YOU are the owner or admin.

### Why This Matters:
The website only shows servers where:
1. ✅ YOU are owner or admin
2. ✅ THE BOT is installed

### How to Add Bot:

**Step 1: Get the Invite Link**
```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1358527215020544222&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

**Step 2: Open the Link**
- Click the link above
- Or copy and paste into browser

**Step 3: Select Your Server**
- Choose a server where YOU are owner/admin
- Click "Continue"
- Click "Authorize"

**Step 4: Verify Bot Joined**
- Go to your Discord server
- Check member list
- You should see "Skyfall" bot online

**Step 5: Test a Command**
```
/ping
```
- Bot should respond immediately
