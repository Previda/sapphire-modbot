---

### **ADVANCED VERIFICATION:**

**Setup:**
```
/verify setup
```

**Configure Security:**
```
/verify config
```

**Options:**
- ✅ **Button Click** - User must click button
- ✅ **Code Verification** - User must enter 6-digit code
- ✅ **Math Problem** - User must solve math problem
- ✅ **Account Age** - Minimum account age (days)
- ✅ **Bot Detection** - Prevents bots from verifying
- ✅ **Auto-Kick** - Kick unverified users after X minutes
- ✅ **Log Channel** - Log verifications to channel

**How It Works:**
1. Admin runs `/verify setup`
2. Panel appears with button
3. User clicks "Start Verification"
4. Bot checks:
   - Is user already verified? → Show message
   - Is user a bot? → Reject
   - Is account old enough? → Check age
5. If enabled, show code challenge
6. If enabled, show math challenge
7. User completes all challenges
8. Bot gives "Verified" role
9. Saves to database
10. Logs to channel (if configured)

**Database:**
```
data/verified-users.json       - Who's verified
data/verification-config.json  - Server settings
data/pending-verifications.json - In-progress verifications
```

### **TICKET SYSTEM:**

**Setup:**
```
/ticket setup
```

**How It Works:**
1. Admin runs `/ticket setup`
2. Panel appears with button
3. User clicks "Create Ticket"
4. Bot checks if user has open ticket
5. Creates private channel
6. Only user + admins can see
7. User explains issue
8. Staff helps
9. Click "Close Ticket"
10. Transcript saved
11. Channel deleted after 5s

**Database:**
```
data/tickets.json              - All tickets
data/transcripts/              - Saved transcripts
```

---

### **WEBSITE-DISCORD SYNC:**

**How It Works:**
```
Every 30 seconds:
1. Bot collects data:
   - All guilds
   - All commands
   - All users
   - Statistics
2. Saves locally
3. Sends to website API
4. Website updates
```

**What Gets Synced:**
- ✅ Guild names, icons, member counts
- ✅ Command list and usage
- ✅ User data and roles
- ✅ Bot statistics
- ✅ Verification stats
- ✅ Ticket stats

**Even if website is down:**
- ✅ Data saved locally

- ✅ Bot keeps running
- ✅ Syncs when website comes back

**Database:**
```
