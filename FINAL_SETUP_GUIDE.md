## 🔧 FIX #1: DISCORD DEVELOPER PORTAL SETUP

**This is the CRITICAL missing step!**

### Steps:

1. **Go to Discord Developer Portal:**
   - Visit: https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Login with your Discord account

2. **Select Your Application:**
   - Click on **Skyfall** (Application ID: 1358527215020544222)

3. **Add OAuth Redirect URL:**
   - Click **OAuth2** in the left sidebar
   - Scroll to **Redirects** section
   - Click **Add Redirect**
   - Add this EXACT URL:
     ```
     https://skyfall-omega.vercel.app/api/auth/callback-discord
     ```
   - Click **Save Changes** (bottom of page)

4. **Verify Client Secret:**
   - Still in OAuth2 page
   - Under **Client Information**
   - Make sure you have your Client Secret: `ZibWF0HAyT_a9MNC9UQILasp5S6LcW0`

## 🔧 FIX #2: TEST DISCORD COMMANDS

**All commands are registered and working! Test them:**

### Basic Commands:
```
/ping
/help
/serverinfo
/userinfo
/botinfo
```

### Fun Commands:
```
/8ball Will this work?
/coinflip
/dice
/poll What's your favorite color? | Red | Blue | Green
```

### Admin Commands:
```
/announce This is a test announcement
/verify
/ticket setup
```

**If these work, the bot is 100% functional!**

## 🔧 FIX #3: DASHBOARD LOGIN

### After adding the redirect URL in Discord Developer Portal:

1. **Clear your browser cache/cookies** for skyfall-omega.vercel.app

2. **Go to dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://skyfall-omega.vercel.app

3. **Click "Login with Discord"**
   - You'll be redirected to Discord
   - Click "Authorize"
   - You should be redirected back to dashboard

4. **You should now see:**
   - Your Discord username (not "Guest")
   - Your 5 real servers in the dropdown
   - Real server data

---

## 📊 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### ✅ Discord Bot (on Pi):
```bash
pm2 status
# Should show: discord-bot | online

pm2 logs discord-bot --lines 5
# Should show: ✅ Discord bot online! Logged in as Skyfall#6931
```

### ✅ Commands in Discord:
- Type `/` in Discord
- You should see all Skyfall commands
- Try `/ping` - should respond with latency
- Try `/help` - should show all 62 commands

### ✅ Dashboard:
- Go to https://skyfall-omega.vercel.app
- Should NOT say "Guest"
- Should show your Discord servers
- Should show real data

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Dashboard still shows "Guest"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you added the redirect URL in Discord Developer Portal
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Make sure the URL is EXACTLY: `https://skyfall-omega.vercel.app/api/auth/callback-discord`

### Problem: Commands say "not implemented"

**Solution:**
```bash
# On your Pi:
pm2 restart discord-bot
pm2 logs discord-bot --lines 10
```

### Problem: No servers showing

**Solution:**
1. Login with Discord first
2. Make sure you're using the Discord account that's in the servers
3. Make sure the bot is in those servers
